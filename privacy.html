        <p>
        This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is being used by Techlab Education (the Company). PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in this Service.

    <div class="row terms-padding">
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder;">What personal information do we collect?</h2>
        <p>
            We opt to collect the minimum amount of Personally Identifiable Information possible.
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style: disc; color: #7b7b7b" type="disc">
            <li>
                For guest users, we do not require any personally identifiable information.
            </li>
            <li>
                For users that create an account with an email account, or by linking an external authentication provider like Google, Facebook, or Twitter, we only collect full names and email address.
            </li>
            <li>
                For student accounts, we do not require any personally identifiable information, and encourage teachers to avoid naming students with personally identifiable information.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
        We provide users a way to access our applications as a guest user, where they are not asked for any Personally Identifying Information. A user may opt to create an account with their email address, at which time they will also be prompted for their name. Student accounts only have a name attached to them, and are not visible to anyone but the authenticated teacher account that created them. Student names are not required to be the full or accurate name of a student, and teachers can always opt to name their students according to any naming scheme.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">When do we collect information?</h2>
        <p>
            We collect detailed analytics on user activity through an analytics service, but this information is anonymized. We also collect information about email addresses and names during the account creation process, and store it using strong encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">How do we use your information?</h2>
        <p>
            We use the information we collect to send transaction emails, welcome emails, and in the case of student accounts, login to our service. We provide an easy opt-out procedure from your user account. We never disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to a third party.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">How do we protect visitor information?</h2>
        <p>
            We only provide articles and information. We never ask for personal or private information like your name, email address, or credit card numbers, to access any part of the site. You may voluntarily submit your email address to us for the aforementioned purpose of periodic emails, but we do not require your email for any part of our website. When we collect your email, it is securely stored in a third-party email list management service, and never shared with any third party.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">Do we use cookies?</h2>
        <p>
            We use cookies only to identify your session on our website with a unique identifier. This identifier is permanently deleted when you log out, and is not used for tracking purposes.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookie preferences.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can continue to use our services with cookies disabled.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">Third-party disclosure</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information (e.g. usage numbers, total number of users) may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">Third-party links</h2>
        <p>
            Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third-party products or services on our website. These third-party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
        <p>
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.
            <br>
            <a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa">See more at the COPPA website.</a>
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold; margin:0px;">According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
        <ol style="list-style: disc; color: #7b7b7b" type="disc">
            <li>
                Users can visit our site anonymously.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum on the first significant page after entering our website.
            </li>
            <li>
                Our Privacy Policy link includes the word "Privacy" and can be easily be found on the page specified above.
            </li>
            <li>
                Users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy page.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">How does our site handle do not track signals?</h2>
        <p>
            We honor do not track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking</h2>
        <p>
            It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
            <br>
            <br>
            The COPPA Rule requires the Service to obtain clear and verifiable parental consent before receiving personal information from children under 13. We rely on educators to obtain and provide appropriate consent, if needed, to collect student information, or make the decision to avoid using personally identifiable information. By providing personally identifiable information for students under 13 years old, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the full authority and rights to provide such information on your student's behalf, and provided appropriate disclosure to students and their parents for sharing the student's information with us.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you are a child under the age of 13, we require the consent of your parents or legal guardian prior to you using the Service, and may not be able to access all features of the Service until you have parental consent.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">Fair Information Practices</h2>
        <p>
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; margin:0px;">In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
            <ol style="list-style: disc; color: #7b7b7b" type="disc">
                <li>
                    We will notify the users via email within 1 business day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We will notify the users via in-site notification within 1 business day.
            </ol>
            <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle, which requires that individuals have a right to pursue legally enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">CAN SPAM Act</h2>
        <p>
            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
            If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can click the "Unsubscribe" link in any email and we will immediately remove you from all future correspondence.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight: bolder; padding-top: 25px;">Contacting Us</h2>
